# Aircury Terms of Service

This is a public revision history of our policies. We are proud to be transparent about our policies and the changes
to them so we have decided to make these publicly available.

We have also made all our policies open source, and you are free to re-use and adapt them for any use.

If you are not interested on the revision history and you only wish to read the latest version of our policies, we
recommend you view them on our [website](https://www.aircury.com) instead, for a better user experience.
